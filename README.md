# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Description

This project aims to predict the future prices of stocks based on historical stock price data provided from kaggle . It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to make predictions. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the code for stock price prediction.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the code for stock price prediction, run the following command:

```bash
python predict_stock_price.py --input data.csv --output predictions.csv
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for stock price prediction contains historical stock price data. It includes columns such as date, open price, close price, volume, etc. Data preprocessing steps may have been applied to clean and transform the data.

## Model

The stock price prediction model is based on linear regression. It was trained on historical stock price data and can make future price predictions.

## Examples

Here is an example of how to use the code to make stock price predictions:

```python
# Example of Using the Stock Price Prediction Model

# Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from predict_stock_price import StockPricePredictor

# Load your own dataset (replace 'data.csv' with your dataset file)
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Initialize the StockPricePredictor
predictor = StockPricePredictor()

# Train the model on historical data
predictor.train(data)

# Define a date for prediction
prediction_date = '2023-10-01'

# Make a stock price prediction for the specified date
predicted_price = predictor.predict_price(prediction_date)

# Display the prediction
print(f'Predicted stock price on {prediction_date}: ${predicted_price:.2f}')

```

## Evaluation

The performance of the stock price prediction model can be evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), or any other relevant evaluation metrics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10 googlecolab
- NumPy: Version 1.19.5
- Pandas: Version 1.2.4
- Scikit-Learn: Version 0.24.2
- Matplotlib: Version 3.3.3

## Contributing

Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome.

This project ensures that you have a predict_stock_price.py script or module with a StockPricePredictor class that is capable of training on historical data and making predictions.
